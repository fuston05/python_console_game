Players have the ability to travel in a N, S, E, W fashion if theres anything in that direction to go to.
Players can use 'global items' but cannot 'take' them. Global items are things that are fixed in a room like a portal or a door.
Players can use non-global items IF they are in the player inventory. Otherwise player needs to 'take' the item first to get it into the player inventory
